### Week Eight Journal Entry

This week we received the instructions for Assessment 2. &nbsp;It requires students to work in groups to create a web application that sources data from one of the social media sites or from Google maps. &nbsp;It includes devising an API (_application programme interface_)to extract the data for the application we create.

Over the next several days I have watched a number of video tutorials on writing APIs to learn what that involves. &nbsp;I have completed a Google Maps tutorial for an API that inserts a marker on a map. &nbsp;I've also completed a set of video tutorials that result in an API obtaining data from a weather website. &nbsp;That website provides current data on weather in cities around the world. &nbsp;The API extracts the data, then uses functions to represent the data in graphical form with circles that are larger or smaller according to the temperature or humidity.

I have also continued working through some JavaScript tutorials in an effort to gain some proficiency in the language.
