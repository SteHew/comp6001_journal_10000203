### Fourth Week Journal Entry

The task for `Week 4` involved utilizing the script supplied in the task instructions to create an app to demonstrate the implementation of menus in GUI programming.
The javascript supplied to us contained code for a menu bar that we installed into a subfile that we called mainmenu.js.  It included the labels 'edit', 'view', 'window' and 'help', with submenus for each.
There was also some code for pop up menus that appear when the user right clicks anywhere on the screen.  I had difficulty getting the pop up menu function to work, until Jeff supplied some more code to achieve that objective.

One key point to learn from this app is the importance of installing menus that the user is familiar with from other applications.  __Familiarity__ is one of a number of core principles of UI Design, as explained by J Portman in _The Core Principles of UI Design_. Retrieved from https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/core-principles-of-ui-design.
Items that should be familiar to the user include icons, navigation bars, buttons, colour coding, and payment processing.

Another aspect of `Week 4` was making a start on Assessment 1, which requires a report that looks at such design principles and then applies them in the construction of an app that allows the user to change the background colour.  So far, I have searched through 6 or 7 websites to find out what the design principles are.
It is evident from my research that there is no commonly agreed list - numbers vary from 6 to 19.  However, some frequently mentioned principles include consistency, simplicity, clarity and structure.
