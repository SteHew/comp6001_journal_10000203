#### First Journal Entry

In the first week I created a repository for the first Electron app,  
the Hello World script with its accompanying node modules, json and  
javascript files.
Next I worked through the Markdown tutorials learning how to use:
* Unordered lists
* _Italics_
* **BOLD** font
* ####### Headers
* ![Inline links](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/3/)
* Backticks for `coding format`
* Block quotes with a _caret_
* Soft breaks  
and other useful Markdown techniques.

In the second week I created another repository to store my journal  
entries.
