### Week Five Journal Entry

This week the focus was on completing Assessment Task 1.

Quite a bit of time was spent on writing up my Report containing 8 principles of GUI design. &nbsp; I chose Familiarity, Consistency, Simplicity, Flexibility, Giving Feedback, Being Purposeful, Knowing the User, and Reducing HTTP requests. &nbsp; The research I had done the previous week had to be integrated into my discussions of each topic.

That exercise concluded with a peer review.  It was not an easy thing to write about someone else's work. &nbsp; I tried to be constructive and affirming of the report that I reviewed. &nbsp; The other challenge was to not expect the other student to have written the same points that I had.

Then I turned to creating my app to change background colour. &nbsp; Many other students had borrowed some code they found online for colour sliders. &nbsp; Their apps looked very professional. &nbsp; However, I tried to do my own thing, picking up snippets of code and ideas from different websites and creating a drop down list.

I struggled to make the buttons perform the required tasks to __Confirm__ and __Reset__ the colours. &nbsp; I reconfigured the javascript functions several times, and worked on the CSS and HTML but could not quite acheive that goal. &nbsp; Howevever, I provided clear instructions to the user what to do at each step. &nbsp; And, I enabled the user to change the background colour to any one of about 10 options.

The other task I completed this week was an small app that incorporated a dragging function. &nbsp; That did not work at first, but Jeff helped me refine my code to complete that task.
